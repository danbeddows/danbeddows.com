      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>I'm Dan Beddows, a web developer based in Manchester, UK ☔️.</p>
      <p>
        I spend most of my time looking after all things tech at INHAUS, a
        digital agency based in Manchester 👨‍💻.
      </p>
      <p>
        I work with clients to advise on, project manage and ship great
        software.
      </p>
      <p>
        Good food, good coffee and hiking make up the most of what I enjoy doing
        with my time away from work 🍕 ☕️ 🥾.
      </p>
      <p>I also have a shameless passion for donuts 🍩.</p>
    </div>
