    # Overview ðŸ‘€

    ### About the business

    Experian is a financial services business operating in a large amount of verticals, including consumer credit scoring, financial product lead
    generation and background checking.

    ### Work involved

    Whilst at Experian I primarily worked on the credit card and loan comparison service. I regularly implemented features end to end, including:
    - building out the UI using React and using the companies own component libraries.
    - writing services in node.js to respond to the front end, and interact with Experian's internal API.
    - writing a combination of unit, integration and E2E tests.

    All of this involved working in a cross functional team, including with analytics, marketing, design and product.
