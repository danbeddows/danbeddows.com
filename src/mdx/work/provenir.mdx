    # Overview ðŸ‘€

    ### About the business

    Provenir is a AI decisioning platform for credit risk, fraud, and compliance. Financial services can utilise Provenir's decisioning for their products.

    ### Work involved

    At Provenir, I created a front end to allow clients to see the results of our data models and analytics that data scientists would create. I regularly implemented features end to end, including:
    - building out the UI using React and Next.js 
    - creating a custom component library and design system, that was consumed in front end apps
    - create data driven components such as graphs, charts and maps
    - setup and work on authorisation, authentication, security, quering, state management and code organisation
    - thoroughly test code across unit, integration and E2E
    - write and design documentation and coding standards to educate the team and keep code quality high

    All of this involved working in a cross functional team, including with product, backend engineers, data scientists, and design
